## 🔎 What is pnpm?
_pnpm (Performant npm)_ is a fast, disk space–efficient package manager for **JavaScript** projects. It was created to solve some of the biggest pain points with npm and Yarn, such as slow installs and excessive disk usage.

The core idea behind pnpm is its **unique node_modules structure** that uses symlinks to avoid duplication of packages. Instead of copying dependencies repeatedly for every project, pnpm stores them in a global content-addressable store and links them where needed.

## PNPM vs. NPM: The Hard Numbers Comparison
PNPM’s core innovation lies in its unique dependency structure, which uses a content-addressable store and symbolic links instead of simply copying files for every project. This change fundamentally alters performance metrics.
Metrics

| Metric | Traditional NPM | PNPM (Performant NPM) | Impact & Explanation | 
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Installation Speed (Cold Cache) | ≈ 29−57 seconds | ≈ 6−14 seconds |Up to 2−3× Faster, PNPM drastically reduces the time spent downloading and extracting by reusing packages already in its global store.
| Installation Speed (Hot Cache) | ≈ 1.5−2 seconds | ≈ 700−900 milliseconds | Up to 2× Faster. Even with an existing cache, PNPM's linking process is more efficient than NPM's hoisting/copying. |
| Disk Space Usage | High (e.g., 5 GB for 5 large projects) | Low (e.g., ≈1 GB for 5 large projects) 50-70% Savings on disk space across all your projects. A single version of a dependency is stored once and linked everywhere.
| Dependency Tree | Flat (Hoisted) | Strict (Content-Addressable) | Prevents "Phantom Dependencies." PNPM ensures your code can only access packages explicitly listed in package.json, leading to fewer elusive runtime bugs.|

## Reasons to Switch to PNPM Today

### 1. Blazing Fast CI/CD Pipelines 🚀
The biggest pain point for large teams is slow build times. When a CI/CD job runs `npm install`, it's often downloading the same packages thousands of times across various builds.
With PNPM, you can **cache the global content store**. Subsequent builds, even on new branches, become lightning fast because the files are already there, dramatically reducing both **pipeline runtime and CI infrastructure costs**.
### 2. Massive Hard Drive Relief 💾
Do you work on multiple projects that share core dependencies like_ React, Vue, or Tailwind?_ Every time you run `npm install`, you **duplicate gigabytes of files**.
PNPM's hard-linking strategy treats your hard drive like a shared library. If a dependency is already in the central store, it just links it into your project's node_modules instead of making a full copy. _No more bloated node_modules_ folders eating up precious SSD space.
### 3. Fewer "It Works on My Machine" Bugs 🐛
NPM's default flat **node_modules structure "hoists" dependencies**, which can unintentionally give your code access to packages you didn't explicitly install (Phantom Dependencies). This leads to unpredictable bugs when dependencies get updated or when you try to publish a package.

PNPM's strict, symlinked structure eliminates this. Your project only sees what it declared in `package.json`, forcing developers to manage dependencies correctly and leading to a _cleaner, more stable dependency graph_.
### 4. Workspaces for Monorepos
pnpm has **built-in support for workspaces**, making it an excellent choice for monorepo architectures. Managing multiple packages across a large codebase becomes seamless.

# ⚙️ How to Get Started
1. Install pnpm
`npm install -g pnpm`

2. Initialize a Project
`pnpm init`

3. Install Dependencies
`pnpm install react react-dom`

4. Run Scripts
pnpm respects the package.json scripts just like npm:
`pnpm run dev`

# 🛠 Example: Using pnpm Workspaces (Monorepo)
A common use case is monorepo development where multiple packages are managed in one repo.
## Step 1: Create pnpm-workspace.yaml
```
packages:
  - "packages/*"
  - "apps/*"
```
Step 2: Install dependencies across all workspaces
`pnpm install`

Step 3: Run scripts for a specific package
`pnpm --filter my-app dev`

This approach makes dependency management in large codebases **organized and efficient.**

👉 Give it a try in your next project and experience the difference.

💡 Pro Tip: You can migrate an existing project to pnpm in just a few minutes. Run `pnpm import` to convert your lockfile from npm or Yarn, and you’re ready to go.
